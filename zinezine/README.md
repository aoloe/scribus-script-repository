# zinezine

Produces a single page folding mini-zine from an 8-pages Scribus document.
It's a native Python solution and the only dependency is PyPDF2.

There is a simple utility script that creates a 8 pages document in A6 format and a main script
that, once the zine has been composed and finalized, takes the 8 pages and arranges them in a single-sheet
PDF with correct order and rotation ready for printing.
