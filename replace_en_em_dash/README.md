# Convert hyphens to en and em dashes

- Double hyphens ('--') are converted to en-dashes.
- Triple hyphens ('---') are converted to em-dashes.
- Single hyphens ('-') and sequence of more hyphens ('----') are left as is.

This is similar to what the `Autoquote.py` distributed with Scribus does for typographic quotes.
